The first is to do little more than provide a platform for buyers and sellers to meet. In this lightly policed model, anyone can play. Buyers must look after their own interests and no one can complain too much if the stocks turn out to be duds. The second approach is more demanding. Companies wishing to join such a market must commit to high standards of governance and grant their shareholders strong ownership rights that are enforceable. Investment accidents can still happen, but outright abuses should be rarer.</p><p>The London stock market was, we assumed, firmly in the second camp.

There’s the face to begin with: meaty, heavy browed, quick-eyed, both grave and wickedly animated, the head and neck invariably rising, as today, out of a white shirt and a black coat. And then the voice, with the inflection of his native Co Wexford, low tones moving easily to lightness, erudite and conspiratorial. Seeing Toíbín advancing toward you across the restaurant is the equivalent of hearing a memorable opening line: “Call me Ishmael”, or – his own favourite this (from Anthony Burgess’s <em>Earthly Powers</em>) – “It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced the archbishop had come to see me.” You sense that Toíbín comes complete with stories.</p><p>In vague homage to his early writing career in Catalonia we are at the <a href=\"http://www.ibericarestaurants.com/restaurants/iberica-marylebone/\">Marylebone outpost of the tapas chain Iberica</a> (which actually has its roots in the northern Spanish province of Asturias, where owner Nacho Manzano developed his two-star Michelin soul food up in the mountains).

Having established the provenance of the Asturian waitress, with whom he falls into fluent conversation about the Spanish distinction between talking “Christian” rather than “Catalan”, he offers a potted history of the weakness of the separatist movement. “Catalan is spoken also on the islands and in Valencia. But they hate Barcelona. Menorca went communist in the time of the civil war. Mallorca went fascist and those tendencies persist as though there was something in the blood or in the soil – while Ibiza just has fun and enjoys life…” As he recounts this history we pick some staple highlights from the menu: patatas bravas, padrón peppers, twice-cooked lamb, jamón ibérico from Manzano’s acorn-fed pigs, and settle back while the plates fill the table.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Tim Adams","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","createdAt":1500303272970,"_id":"GjFHDvRRT5ajefQ8"}

And whereas in the past it was lower-skilled work that was displaced, the jobs that will be lost in the coming wave of smart machines are ones that we traditionally regard as “white-collar” or middle-class. And that would be a very big deal, because if there’s no middle class the prospects for the survival of democracy are poor.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"John Naughton","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation","createdAt":1500303271604,"_id":"inayP46Z44WsQwmR"}

New research confirms that women are not, as a rule, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40504076\">freezing their eggs</a> for career reasons, but instead because they don’t have a partner.

{"title":"Aramco may be big, but fawning to Saudis diminishes London","contents":"Giving the state-owned oil firm a premium stock market listing would make a mockery of all the investor protection such a category entails<p>There are two ways to run a stock market. The first is to do little more than provide a platform for buyers and sellers to meet. In this lightly policed model, anyone can play. Buyers must look after their own interests and no one can complain too much if the stocks turn out to be duds. The second approach is more demanding. Companies wishing to join such a market must commit to high standards of governance and grant their shareholders strong ownership rights that are enforceable. Investment accidents can still happen, but outright abuses should be rarer.</p><p>The London stock market was, we assumed, firmly in the second camp. In days of old, the City may not have been overly fussy about shareholder rights. But in the second decade of the 21st century – and especially after a dangerous experiment from 2010 in attracting Russian companies – the debate had surely been settled in favour of high standards. After all, a reputation for trust benefits everyone. It attracts long-term investors with big pools of permanent capital and allows companies to enjoy lower funding costs.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Guardian Staff","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca","createdAt":1500303571187,"_id":"7RiqObhDodhrrF4p"}

There’s the face to begin with: meaty, heavy browed, quick-eyed, both grave and wickedly animated, the head and neck invariably rising, as today, out of a white shirt and a black coat. And then the voice, with the inflection of his native Co Wexford, low tones moving easily to lightness, erudite and conspiratorial. Seeing Toíbín advancing toward you across the restaurant is the equivalent of hearing a memorable opening line: “Call me Ishmael”, or – his own favourite this (from Anthony Burgess’s <em>Earthly Powers</em>) – “It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced the archbishop had come to see me.” You sense that Toíbín comes complete with stories.</p><p>In vague homage to his early writing career in Catalonia we are at the <a href=\"http://www.ibericarestaurants.com/restaurants/iberica-marylebone/\">Marylebone outpost of the tapas chain Iberica</a> (which actually has its roots in the northern Spanish province of Asturias, where owner Nacho Manzano developed his two-star Michelin soul food up in the mountains). Toíbín has been doing an interview with the BBC up the road about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/colm-toibin-how-henry-james-family-tried-to-keep-him-in-the-closet\">the sex life of Henry James</a> and he’s had no breakfast – “I just lay in the hotel bed brooding as ever” – so he’s starving. Having established the provenance of the Asturian waitress, with whom he falls into fluent conversation about the Spanish distinction between talking “Christian” rather than “Catalan”, he offers a potted history of the weakness of the separatist movement. “Catalan is spoken also on the islands and in Valencia. But they hate Barcelona. Menorca went communist in the time of the civil war. Mallorca went fascist and those tendencies persist as though there was something in the blood or in the soil – while Ibiza just has fun and enjoys life…” As he recounts this history we pick some staple highlights from the menu: patatas bravas, padrón peppers, twice-cooked lamb, jamón ibérico from Manzano’s acorn-fed pigs, and settle back while the plates fill the table.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Tim Adams","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","createdAt":1500303571409,"_id":"GjFHDvRRT5ajefQ8"}

And whereas in the past it was lower-skilled work that was displaced, the jobs that will be lost in the coming wave of smart machines are ones that we traditionally regard as “white-collar” or middle-class. And that would be a very big deal, because if there’s no middle class the prospects for the survival of democracy are poor.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"John Naughton","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation","createdAt":1500303601251,"_id":"inayP46Z44WsQwmR"}

{"title":"Aramco may be big, but fawning to Saudis diminishes London","contents":"Giving the state-owned oil firm a premium stock market listing would make a mockery of all the investor protection such a category entails<p>There are two ways to run a stock market. The first is to do little more than provide a platform for buyers and sellers to meet. In this lightly policed model, anyone can play. Buyers must look after their own interests and no one can complain too much if the stocks turn out to be duds. The second approach is more demanding. Companies wishing to join such a market must commit to high standards of governance and grant their shareholders strong ownership rights that are enforceable. Investment accidents can still happen, but outright abuses should be rarer.</p><p>The London stock market was, we assumed, firmly in the second camp. In days of old, the City may not have been overly fussy about shareholder rights. But in the second decade of the 21st century – and especially after a dangerous experiment from 2010 in attracting Russian companies – the debate had surely been settled in favour of high standards. After all, a reputation for trust benefits everyone. It attracts long-term investors with big pools of permanent capital and allows companies to enjoy lower funding costs.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Guardian Staff","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca","createdAt":1500303601262,"_id":"7RiqObhDodhrrF4p"}

Wikipedia’s “Premise” section for the film states merely: “The plot is unknown.”</p><p>We have no virtually no concept of why Luke Skywalker wants the Jedi to “end”, as revealed in April’s teaser, and little idea who <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/05/24/star-wars-the-last-jedi-benicio-del-toro/#Ktkqoxb9hqqw\">Benicio Del Toro’s grungey-looking “DJ”</a> is, even though it seems likely he’ll play a major part in events. We don’t even really have any great sense of the themes that will drive the new episode. Will it follow the path well-trodden by 1980’s Empire Strikes Back – a vengeful attack from the dark side; a student learning the ways of the Force from a grizzled master; a shocking final twist? Or will it attempt to break new ground for this venerable old saga? </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Ben Child","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23","createdAt":1500303601322,"_id":"YHwbQWy8JMozARLg"}

There’s the face to begin with: meaty, heavy browed, quick-eyed, both grave and wickedly animated, the head and neck invariably rising, as today, out of a white shirt and a black coat. And then the voice, with the inflection of his native Co Wexford, low tones moving easily to lightness, erudite and conspiratorial. Seeing Toíbín advancing toward you across the restaurant is the equivalent of hearing a memorable opening line: “Call me Ishmael”, or – his own favourite this (from Anthony Burgess’s <em>Earthly Powers</em>) – “It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced the archbishop had come to see me.” You sense that Toíbín comes complete with stories.</p><p>In vague homage to his early writing career in Catalonia we are at the <a href=\"http://www.ibericarestaurants.com/restaurants/iberica-marylebone/\">Marylebone outpost of the tapas chain Iberica</a> (which actually has its roots in the northern Spanish province of Asturias, where owner Nacho Manzano developed his two-star Michelin soul food up in the mountains).

Having established the provenance of the Asturian waitress, with whom he falls into fluent conversation about the Spanish distinction between talking “Christian” rather than “Catalan”, he offers a potted history of the weakness of the separatist movement. “Catalan is spoken also on the islands and in Valencia. But they hate Barcelona. Menorca went communist in the time of the civil war. Mallorca went fascist and those tendencies persist as though there was something in the blood or in the soil – while Ibiza just has fun and enjoys life…” As he recounts this history we pick some staple highlights from the menu: patatas bravas, padrón peppers, twice-cooked lamb, jamón ibérico from Manzano’s acorn-fed pigs, and settle back while the plates fill the table.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Tim Adams","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","createdAt":1500303601342,"_id":"GjFHDvRRT5ajefQ8"}

And whereas in the past it was lower-skilled work that was displaced, the jobs that will be lost in the coming wave of smart machines are ones that we traditionally regard as “white-collar” or middle-class. And that would be a very big deal, because if there’s no middle class the prospects for the survival of democracy are poor.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"John Naughton","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation","createdAt":1500303631431,"_id":"inayP46Z44WsQwmR"}

{"title":"Aramco may be big, but fawning to Saudis diminishes London","contents":"Giving the state-owned oil firm a premium stock market listing would make a mockery of all the investor protection such a category entails<p>There are two ways to run a stock market. The first is to do little more than provide a platform for buyers and sellers to meet. In this lightly policed model, anyone can play. Buyers must look after their own interests and no one can complain too much if the stocks turn out to be duds. The second approach is more demanding. Companies wishing to join such a market must commit to high standards of governance and grant their shareholders strong ownership rights that are enforceable. Investment accidents can still happen, but outright abuses should be rarer.</p><p>The London stock market was, we assumed, firmly in the second camp. In days of old, the City may not have been overly fussy about shareholder rights. But in the second decade of the 21st century – and especially after a dangerous experiment from 2010 in attracting Russian companies – the debate had surely been settled in favour of high standards. After all, a reputation for trust benefits everyone. It attracts long-term investors with big pools of permanent capital and allows companies to enjoy lower funding costs.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Guardian Staff","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca","createdAt":1500303631431,"_id":"7RiqObhDodhrrF4p"}

Wikipedia’s “Premise” section for the film states merely: “The plot is unknown.”</p><p>We have no virtually no concept of why Luke Skywalker wants the Jedi to “end”, as revealed in April’s teaser, and little idea who <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/05/24/star-wars-the-last-jedi-benicio-del-toro/#Ktkqoxb9hqqw\">Benicio Del Toro’s grungey-looking “DJ”</a> is, even though it seems likely he’ll play a major part in events. We don’t even really have any great sense of the themes that will drive the new episode. Will it follow the path well-trodden by 1980’s Empire Strikes Back – a vengeful attack from the dark side; a student learning the ways of the Force from a grizzled master; a shocking final twist? Or will it attempt to break new ground for this venerable old saga? </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Ben Child","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23","createdAt":1500303631534,"_id":"YHwbQWy8JMozARLg"}

There’s the face to begin with: meaty, heavy browed, quick-eyed, both grave and wickedly animated, the head and neck invariably rising, as today, out of a white shirt and a black coat. And then the voice, with the inflection of his native Co Wexford, low tones moving easily to lightness, erudite and conspiratorial. Seeing Toíbín advancing toward you across the restaurant is the equivalent of hearing a memorable opening line: “Call me Ishmael”, or – his own favourite this (from Anthony Burgess’s <em>Earthly Powers</em>) – “It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced the archbishop had come to see me.” You sense that Toíbín comes complete with stories.</p><p>In vague homage to his early writing career in Catalonia we are at the <a href=\"http://www.ibericarestaurants.com/restaurants/iberica-marylebone/\">Marylebone outpost of the tapas chain Iberica</a> (which actually has its roots in the northern Spanish province of Asturias, where owner Nacho Manzano developed his two-star Michelin soul food up in the mountains).

Having established the provenance of the Asturian waitress, with whom he falls into fluent conversation about the Spanish distinction between talking “Christian” rather than “Catalan”, he offers a potted history of the weakness of the separatist movement. “Catalan is spoken also on the islands and in Valencia. But they hate Barcelona. Menorca went communist in the time of the civil war. Mallorca went fascist and those tendencies persist as though there was something in the blood or in the soil – while Ibiza just has fun and enjoys life…” As he recounts this history we pick some staple highlights from the menu: patatas bravas, padrón peppers, twice-cooked lamb, jamón ibérico from Manzano’s acorn-fed pigs, and settle back while the plates fill the table.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Tim Adams","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","createdAt":1500303631569,"_id":"GjFHDvRRT5ajefQ8"}

And whereas in the past it was lower-skilled work that was displaced, the jobs that will be lost in the coming wave of smart machines are ones that we traditionally regard as “white-collar” or middle-class. And that would be a very big deal, because if there’s no middle class the prospects for the survival of democracy are poor.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"John Naughton","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation","createdAt":1500303660466,"_id":"inayP46Z44WsQwmR"}

{"title":"Aramco may be big, but fawning to Saudis diminishes London","contents":"Giving the state-owned oil firm a premium stock market listing would make a mockery of all the investor protection such a category entails<p>There are two ways to run a stock market. The first is to do little more than provide a platform for buyers and sellers to meet. In this lightly policed model, anyone can play. Buyers must look after their own interests and no one can complain too much if the stocks turn out to be duds. The second approach is more demanding. Companies wishing to join such a market must commit to high standards of governance and grant their shareholders strong ownership rights that are enforceable. Investment accidents can still happen, but outright abuses should be rarer.</p><p>The London stock market was, we assumed, firmly in the second camp. In days of old, the City may not have been overly fussy about shareholder rights. But in the second decade of the 21st century – and especially after a dangerous experiment from 2010 in attracting Russian companies – the debate had surely been settled in favour of high standards. After all, a reputation for trust benefits everyone. It attracts long-term investors with big pools of permanent capital and allows companies to enjoy lower funding costs.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Guardian Staff","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca","createdAt":1500303660466,"_id":"7RiqObhDodhrrF4p"}

Wikipedia’s “Premise” section for the film states merely: “The plot is unknown.”</p><p>We have no virtually no concept of why Luke Skywalker wants the Jedi to “end”, as revealed in April’s teaser, and little idea who <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/05/24/star-wars-the-last-jedi-benicio-del-toro/#Ktkqoxb9hqqw\">Benicio Del Toro’s grungey-looking “DJ”</a> is, even though it seems likely he’ll play a major part in events. We don’t even really have any great sense of the themes that will drive the new episode. Will it follow the path well-trodden by 1980’s Empire Strikes Back – a vengeful attack from the dark side; a student learning the ways of the Force from a grizzled master; a shocking final twist? Or will it attempt to break new ground for this venerable old saga? </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Ben Child","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23","createdAt":1500303660528,"_id":"YHwbQWy8JMozARLg"}

There’s the face to begin with: meaty, heavy browed, quick-eyed, both grave and wickedly animated, the head and neck invariably rising, as today, out of a white shirt and a black coat. And then the voice, with the inflection of his native Co Wexford, low tones moving easily to lightness, erudite and conspiratorial. Seeing Toíbín advancing toward you across the restaurant is the equivalent of hearing a memorable opening line: “Call me Ishmael”, or – his own favourite this (from Anthony Burgess’s <em>Earthly Powers</em>) – “It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced the archbishop had come to see me.” You sense that Toíbín comes complete with stories.</p><p>In vague homage to his early writing career in Catalonia we are at the <a href=\"http://www.ibericarestaurants.com/restaurants/iberica-marylebone/\">Marylebone outpost of the tapas chain Iberica</a> (which actually has its roots in the northern Spanish province of Asturias, where owner Nacho Manzano developed his two-star Michelin soul food up in the mountains).

Having established the provenance of the Asturian waitress, with whom he falls into fluent conversation about the Spanish distinction between talking “Christian” rather than “Catalan”, he offers a potted history of the weakness of the separatist movement. “Catalan is spoken also on the islands and in Valencia. But they hate Barcelona. Menorca went communist in the time of the civil war. Mallorca went fascist and those tendencies persist as though there was something in the blood or in the soil – while Ibiza just has fun and enjoys life…” As he recounts this history we pick some staple highlights from the menu: patatas bravas, padrón peppers, twice-cooked lamb, jamón ibérico from Manzano’s acorn-fed pigs, and settle back while the plates fill the table.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Tim Adams","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","createdAt":1500303660548,"_id":"GjFHDvRRT5ajefQ8"}

And whereas in the past it was lower-skilled work that was displaced, the jobs that will be lost in the coming wave of smart machines are ones that we traditionally regard as “white-collar” or middle-class. And that would be a very big deal, because if there’s no middle class the prospects for the survival of democracy are poor.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"John Naughton","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/16/come-friendly-robots-and-take-our-dullest-jobs-automation","createdAt":1500303690593,"_id":"inayP46Z44WsQwmR"}

{"title":"Aramco may be big, but fawning to Saudis diminishes London","contents":"Giving the state-owned oil firm a premium stock market listing would make a mockery of all the investor protection such a category entails<p>There are two ways to run a stock market. The first is to do little more than provide a platform for buyers and sellers to meet. In this lightly policed model, anyone can play. Buyers must look after their own interests and no one can complain too much if the stocks turn out to be duds. The second approach is more demanding. Companies wishing to join such a market must commit to high standards of governance and grant their shareholders strong ownership rights that are enforceable. Investment accidents can still happen, but outright abuses should be rarer.</p><p>The London stock market was, we assumed, firmly in the second camp. In days of old, the City may not have been overly fussy about shareholder rights. But in the second decade of the 21st century – and especially after a dangerous experiment from 2010 in attracting Russian companies – the debate had surely been settled in favour of high standards. After all, a reputation for trust benefits everyone. It attracts long-term investors with big pools of permanent capital and allows companies to enjoy lower funding costs.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Guardian Staff","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/16/saudi-aramco-london-stock-market-premium-listing-fca","createdAt":1500303690603,"_id":"7RiqObhDodhrrF4p"}

Wikipedia’s “Premise” section for the film states merely: “The plot is unknown.”</p><p>We have no virtually no concept of why Luke Skywalker wants the Jedi to “end”, as revealed in April’s teaser, and little idea who <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2017/05/24/star-wars-the-last-jedi-benicio-del-toro/#Ktkqoxb9hqqw\">Benicio Del Toro’s grungey-looking “DJ”</a> is, even though it seems likely he’ll play a major part in events. We don’t even really have any great sense of the themes that will drive the new episode. Will it follow the path well-trodden by 1980’s Empire Strikes Back – a vengeful attack from the dark side; a student learning the ways of the Force from a grizzled master; a shocking final twist? Or will it attempt to break new ground for this venerable old saga? </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Ben Child","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/16/star-wars-the-last-jedi-behind-the-scenes-video-five-things-we-learned-disney-d23","createdAt":1500303690786,"_id":"YHwbQWy8JMozARLg"}

There’s the face to begin with: meaty, heavy browed, quick-eyed, both grave and wickedly animated, the head and neck invariably rising, as today, out of a white shirt and a black coat. And then the voice, with the inflection of his native Co Wexford, low tones moving easily to lightness, erudite and conspiratorial. Seeing Toíbín advancing toward you across the restaurant is the equivalent of hearing a memorable opening line: “Call me Ishmael”, or – his own favourite this (from Anthony Burgess’s <em>Earthly Powers</em>) – “It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced the archbishop had come to see me.” You sense that Toíbín comes complete with stories.</p><p>In vague homage to his early writing career in Catalonia we are at the <a href=\"http://www.ibericarestaurants.com/restaurants/iberica-marylebone/\">Marylebone outpost of the tapas chain Iberica</a> (which actually has its roots in the northern Spanish province of Asturias, where owner Nacho Manzano developed his two-star Michelin soul food up in the mountains). Toíbín has been doing an interview with the BBC up the road about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/colm-toibin-how-henry-james-family-tried-to-keep-him-in-the-closet\">the sex life of Henry James</a> and he’s had no breakfast – “I just lay in the hotel bed brooding as ever” – so he’s starving. Having established the provenance of the Asturian waitress, with whom he falls into fluent conversation about the Spanish distinction between talking “Christian” rather than “Catalan”, he offers a potted history of the weakness of the separatist movement. “Catalan is spoken also on the islands and in Valencia. But they hate Barcelona. Menorca went communist in the time of the civil war. Mallorca went fascist and those tendencies persist as though there was something in the blood or in the soil – while Ibiza just has fun and enjoys life…” As he recounts this history we pick some staple highlights from the menu: patatas bravas, padrón peppers, twice-cooked lamb, jamón ibérico from Manzano’s acorn-fed pigs, and settle back while the plates fill the table.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump\">Continue reading...</a>","author":"Tim Adams","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","feedURL":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss","feedTitle":"The Guardian","articleGUID":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/16/colm-toibin-interview-brexit-expats-irish-influence-trump","createdAt":1500303690816,"_id":"GjFHDvRRT5ajefQ8"}
